My name is Fred Massin, Univ. of Utah, I used NNK for structural modeling of Piton de la Fournaise volcano (La Réunion, France) and for tectonic and volcano-tectonic earthquakes clustering at Yellowstone volcano (Wyoming, US). I published an article using NNK : [Structures and evolution of the plumbing system of Piton de la Fournaise volcano inferred from clustering of 2007 eruptive cycle seismicity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027311000333). F. Massin, V. Ferrazzini, P. Bachèlery, A. Nercessian, Z. Duputel, T. Staudacher. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, Volume 202, Issues 1-2, 30 April 2011, Pages 96-106. And I am working on more.

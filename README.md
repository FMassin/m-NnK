Introduction

NaiNo-Kami (NNK) is a tool to extract and make use of coherent waveforms of impulsive signals. Such cluster of events are named multiplets when using earthquake signals in seismology.

NNK is a suite of Matlab and Perl scripts for earthquake waveform clustering from cross-correlation. Seismological exploitations modules are included for 1D and 3D location, 1D and 3D double difference relocation, focal mechanism determination, coda wave interferometry and more to come.

NNK read an write SAC files (see the SAC program). Sac format is designed for signal processing. It is a versatile, widely used format which could content any 1d time serie with a lot of metadata. Please consider using it.

Ad Hoc (AH) files reading capabilities can be used when the CORAL toolbox (by Kenneth C. Creager) is installed on your machine.
